# Pokemon Battle Simulator
An app using the pokemonapi.co to see effectiveness of Pokemon based on their type(grass, water, electric etc), let's you know which is super-effective or normal!

### Goal: Build a Simple web app using the pokemon api. Wanted to add a few extra functions for comparison between pokemon types and the ones that are super-effective

### How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javascript

### Status:
Supe-Effective comparisons are done, but don't have anything lower than 2x effectiveness, as of now if it's not 2x it defaults to normal
